  "summary": "I am a software engineer with over eight years of experience and a proven ability to quickly adapt to various technology stacks. I have played a key role on two product teams at idealo for the past five years. Although I have the most experience in back-end and infrastructure development, I've been exposed to front-end development in the past two years. A vital aspect of my work is helping the business thrive. Before diving into the code, I always aim to understand the product and the customer. I lead and work by applying principles of extreme ownership.",
